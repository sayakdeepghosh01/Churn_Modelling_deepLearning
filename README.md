Based upon data of employees of a bank we calculate whether a employee stands a chance to stay in the company or not.
the data set is taken from the kaggle (link:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubh0799/churn-modelling).
we use a basic neural networking model to predict the model. 
the Accuracy Seems good of the prediction is 87.05%.
